;;Replacement keys so that card writers don't have to include so many
;; html tags for repetitive elements.  The replacements in this file
;; are ran against all text, including title, subtitle, card type,
;; game text, collector's info, and stats, so tread lightly.

;; This is not regex based, only simple search/replace.
;; You could utilize this to add more than just bold tags if you want,
;; it's just that bolded keywords are about the only systematic tags.
