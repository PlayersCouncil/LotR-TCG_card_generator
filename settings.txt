;;
;; These must be the name of an installed font, such as "Arial" or
;; "Comic Sans MS".  The name of the font may surprise you, so double-check
;; what you actually have installed.

;; game_text_font is used for the non-lore part of the game text.  Also, this
;; font contains the culture icons.  If you want to replace those you will need
;; to do your due diligence in including those same icons in the same glyph
;; positions.

;; Faithful Stone for such a card).  The space charcater has had its width

;; size to pack all the detail in that Huge provides.

[debug_regions] = False

;; If this is set to False, exporting to file will be skipped when the deck
;; is built.  This will noticably speed up card generation (since each card
;; is written to disk as it is generated.  This is mostly useful if you are
;; rapidly testing changes or getting wording/formatting right, and so don't

;; 270 degrees for them to be used here.  If you have provided site templates
;; of your own that are in portrait mode, set this value to False.  If you do
;; so, make sure the site_sanctuary_X and site_standard_X files are all
;; manually rotated into portrait mode as well.

;; By default the 'mockup' tag is used on a card by card basis, but if you'd
;; rather force all cards to be drawn in the mockup style, this will do so

;; work-in-progress nature impossible to miss.
