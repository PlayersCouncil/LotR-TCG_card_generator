;; these to use other fonts (such as tengwar).
;;
;; These must be the name of an installed font, such as "Arial" or
;; "Comic Sans MS".  The name of the font may surprise you, so double-check
;; what you actually have installed.

;; game_text_font is used for the non-lore part of the game text.  Also, this
;; font contains the culture icons.  If you want to replace those you will need
;; to do your due diligence in including those same icons in the same glyph
;; positions.
